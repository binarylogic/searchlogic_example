module Searchgasm
  # = Searchgasm Helpers
  #
  # Provides helpers for rails applications that make using Searchgasm extremely easy. Please see Searchgasm::Helpers::ControlTypes and Searchgasm::Helpers::Form for more information on how to use these helpers.
  #
  # Also, I am always looking to improve these. I feel confident that I made these flexible enough for just about any need, but there is always that one crazy instance. If these helpers restrict you
  # in any way please contact me and let me know. You can do some on my website: www.binarylogic.com. I will more than likely add in your functionality that week.
