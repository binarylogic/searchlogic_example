    module Utilities # :nodoc:
      # Builds a hash of params for creating a url and preserves any existing params. You can pass this into url_for and build your url. Although most rails helpers accept a hash.
      #
      # Let's take the page_link helper. Here is the code behind that helper:
      #
      #   link_to("Page 2", searchgasm_params(:search_params => {:page => 2}))
      #
      # That's pretty much it. So if you wanted to roll your own link to execute a search, go for it. It's pretty simple. Pass conditions instead of the page, set how the search will be ordered, etc.
      #
      # <b>Be careful</b> when taking this approach though. Searchgasm helps you out when you use form_for. For example, when you use the per_page_select helper, it adds in a hidden form field with the value of the page. So when
      # your search form is submitted it searches the document for that element, finds the current value, which is the current per_page value, and includes that in the search. So when a user searches the per_page
      # value stays consistent. If you use the searchgasm_params you are on your own. I am always curious how people are using searchgasm. So if you are building your own helpers contact me and maybe I can help you
      # and add in a helper for you, making it an *official* feature.
      #
      # === Options
      # * <tt>:params_scope</tt> -- default: :search, this is the scope in which your search params will be preserved (params[:search]). If you don't want a scope and want your options to be at base leve in params such as params[:page], params[:per_page], etc, then set this to nil.
      # * <tt>:search_obj</tt> -- default: @#{params_scope}, this is your search object, everything revolves around this. It will try to infer the name from your params_scope. If your params_scope is :search it will try to get @search, etc. If it can not be inferred by this, you need to pass the object itself.
      # * <tt>:params</tt> -- default: nil, Additional params to add to the url, must be a hash
      # * <tt>:exclude_params</tt> -- default: nil, params you want to exclude. This is nifty because it does a "deep delete". So you can pass {:param1 => {:param2 => :param3}} and it will make sure param3 does not get include. param1 and param2 will not be touched. This also accepts an array or just a symbol or string.
      # * <tt>:search_params</tt> -- default: nil, Additional search params to add to the url, must be a hash. Adds the options into the :params_scope.
      # * <tt>:exclude_search_params</tt> -- default: nil, Same as :exclude_params but for the :search_params.

      # Similar to searchgasm_hash, but instead returns a string url. The reason this exists is to assist in creating urls in javascript. It's the muscle behind all of the select helpers that searchgasm provides.
      # Take the instance where you want to do:
      #
      #   :onchange => "window.location = '#{url_for(searchgasm_params)}&my_param=' + this.value;"
      #
      # Well the above obviously won't work. Do you need to apped the url with a ? or a &? What about that tricky :params_scope? That's where this is handy, beacuse it does all of the params string building for you. Check it out:
      #
      #   :onchange => "window.location = '" + searchgasm_url(:literal_search_params => {:per_page => "' + escape(this.value) + '"}) + "';"
      #
      # or what about something a little more tricky?
      #
      #   :onchange => "window.location = '" + searchgasm_url(:literal_search_params => {:conditions => {:name_contains => "' + escape(this.value) + '"}}) + "';"
      #
      # I have personally used this for an event calendar. Above the calendar there was a drop down for each month. Here is the code:
      #
      #   :onchange => "window.location = '" + searchgasm_url(:literal_search_params => {:conditions => {:occurs_at_after => "' + escape(this.value) + '"}}) + "';"
      #
      # Now when the user changes the month in the drop down it just runs a new search that sets my conditions to occurs_at_after = selected month. Then in my controller I set occurs_at_before = occurs_at_after.at_end_of_month.

      # Take the instance where a user orders the data by something other than the default, and then does a search. The user would expect the search to remember what the user selected to order the data by, right?
      # What searchgasm does is add in some hidden fields, somewhere in the page, the represent the searchgasm "state". These are automatically added for you when you use the searchgasm helpers.
      # Such as: page_links, page_link, order_by_link, per_page_select, etc. So if you are using those you do not need to worry about this helper.
      #
      # If for some reason you do not use any of these you need to put the searchgasm state on your page somewhere. Somewhere where the state will *always* be up-to-date, which would be most likely be in the
      # partial that renders your search results (assuming you are using AJAX). Otherwise when the user starts a new search, the state will be reset. Meaning the order_by, per_page, etc will all be reset.
