=== Key files

Here are the files you want to glance at:

1.	All of the controllers and their respective views
2.	config/initializers/searchgasm.rb

=== Generate Test Data

First you need to install the Populator and Faker gems. You can do this by either using rails' gems task

<tt>rake gems:install</tt>

or by installing the gems manually

<tt>sudo gem install populator</tt>

<tt>sudo gem install faker</tt>

After you have set up the gems and migrated your database you can generate the data:

<tt>rake db:populate</tt>

The populate task will create 8 user groups with 0 to 150 users each. Each user can have upto 7 orders. (see lib/tasks/populate.rb)
